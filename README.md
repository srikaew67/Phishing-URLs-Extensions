## Frontend Setup
1. **Check Node.js Version:**
   Make sure Node.js is installed on your machine. Run the following command to check the version of Node.js installed:
   ```bash
   npm -v
2. **Navigate to Frontend Directory**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
3. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
4. **Run the Development Server on localhost**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
4. **Build the react app**
    ```bash
    npm run build
You will see a new directory created called dist/ which contains the necessary files to create a chrome extension app. Once the build succeeds, head over to browsers extensions , enable ‘Developer mode’ and ‘Load unpacked’ by selecting the dist directory that was just created!
